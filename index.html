    <a href="#"> Life Of Lionel Messi;The Gretest Footballer Bar None</a>
     <div class="sectionA" id="red">
        <p id="ptag">Lionel Messi is an Argentine soccer player. He was one of the most dominant players in the first two decades of the 2000s. Messi was named the men’s world player of the year seven times (2009–12, 2015, 2019, and 2021).


Messi was born on June 24, 1987, in Rosario, Argentina. He began playing soccer as a young boy. By 1995 he was a good enough player to join Newell’s Old Boys, a top-division soccer club in Rosario. Messi’s skills won attention on both sides of the Atlantic Ocean, and at the age of 13 Messi moved to Barcelona, Spain, to join FC Barcelona’s under-14 team. He scored 21 goals in 14 games for the junior team. He rose through the ranks until he made his first-team debut at age 16. </p>

    <div class= "sectionB">
        <p>In the 2004–05 season Messi, at 17 years old, became the youngest official player and goal scorer for the Spanish La Liga (the country’s highest division of soccer). The next year Messi helped FC Barcelona win the Champions League (the European club championship) title. By 2008 he was one of the most dominant players in the world. During the 2008–09 season Messi scored 38 goals in 51 games and led his team to its first “treble”—winning three major European club titles in one season. He won his first FIFA World Player of the Year honors that year as well. The following season he scored 34 goals, and Barcelona repeated as La Liga champions. Messi won the Golden Shoe award as Europe’s top scorer and his second world player of the year award.

During the 2010–11 season Messi led Barcelona to La Liga and Champions League titles. He became the first player to win a third straight world player of the year award. In March 2012, at the age of 24, he scored his 233rd goal. This made him Barcelona’s all-time leading scorer in La Liga play. Messi went on to break a 39-year-old major European football league record when he finished the 2011–12 season with 73 goals in all competitions. This performance led to him being the first player to ever win a fourth world player of the year award.

Messi continued to perform at the highest level. In 2014 he broke the career scoring records for both the Champions League (72 goals) and La Liga (253 goals). </p>

    <p>Despite his career in Spain, Messi maintained strong ties with his home country of Argentina. He has played on various Argentine national teams from 2005. He played on Argentina’s winning 2005 FIFA World Youth Championship team and helped sweep Argentina to the gold medal at the 2008 Olympic Games. Messi was a key player on Argentina’s World Cup teams. In 2014 Messi was responsible for getting the team to its first World Cup final in 24 years. Even though Argentina lost to Germany, Messi won the Golden Ball award for the tournament’s best player. In 2022 Messi led Argentina to its first World Cup championship since 1986.
    
    
    The famouse Football comentator Peter Drury Said in the match:He was beautiful.he was the poin of difference.He has always been the point of difference...

    unparalled!

And maybe......,today there will of course those who argue.always those who debate and the debate can race on if you like.....
But as he falls in love with the object in the world that his heart most desired.it is hard to  escape the supposition that he has rendered himself today.

The greatest of all time.
